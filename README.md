# hfunction-paper-supplement

This repository is meant as a supplement to a recently submitted paper concerning the so called $h$-functions ([see](https://searchlibrary.adelaide.edu.au/discovery/fulldisplay/alma9916113203101831/61USOUTHAUS_INST:ROR) Walden and Ward for a nice survey on these functions). In the mentioned paper, a $h$-function candidate is constructed using a 
series of integral transforms. In this repository, I will explain what this function is, and explain the code behind
the integral transforms, as well as the derivation of their forms.
